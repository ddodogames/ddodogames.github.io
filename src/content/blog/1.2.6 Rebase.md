  The ForgeScript version of Dodo-Bot has been updated again!
---

## Note
Rebase version of Dodo-Bot uses ForgeScript meanwhile the normal version aka v2 uses aoi.js, so please do not take codes from Rebase version then add it into a aoi.js bot as both packages have differences.

After another long time of working on the next Rebase release, it's finally done and it's now available as a stable version! Here are the changes:

# Changes
* Bumped ForgeScript version to `2.2.0`
* Added `<user.globalname>` for Welcomer, Leave and Leveling
* The buttons for moving the Snake in `snake` should now be easier to see
* **Welcomer** & **Leave**: make `<username>` return usernames with discriminator for bots
* Added a command called `banner`
* `userinfo` now checks if a bot account is verified
* Increased page limit in `leaderboard` to 20

# Bug Fixes
* Messages from `leveling`, `welcomer` and `leave` are now fully consistent between test and normal ones
* Fixed a leftover of the old Github username in `README` file
* Improved the grammar of empty leaderboard error seen in `leaderboard` cmd

# Other
* Added support for responding to message edits triggering commands
* Slightly updated the ordering of sections in `stats` command
* Replaced the package `dotenv` with `@dotenvx/dotenvx` for better Env support
* Renamed several placeholders from `Welcomer`, `Leave` and `Leveling` to use `user` instead of `member`
* The setup file has been rewritten in Javascript
* `--buildinfo` for `version`: Make the displayed build branch hyperlinked
* Added Green Apple as part of the foods to catch in `snake` command
