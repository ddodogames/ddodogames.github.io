The first build of 2.2.4 is now officially available as a GitHub release for testing. This build took weeks to development and includes improvements to Dodo-Bot including some internal changes


# Changes
* Added command usage section for `commandinfo`
* The buttons for moving the Snake in `snake` should now be easier to see
* Increased page limit in `leaderboard` to 20

# Bug fixes
* Fixed "Current Setup" setting being inconsistent in `welcomer` and `leave` when pressing the "Toggle" button
* Fixed the user app invite link seen in `invite` (if enabled by bot owner) not working
* Fixed a issue where sometimes some commands like `wyr` will simply return "dead" as a response rather than the actual error
* Improved the grammar of empty leaderboard error seen in `leaderboard` cmd

# Other

## dotenvx
The package `dotenv` has been replaced with `@dotenvx/dotenvx` for better Env support. This also enables encryption support, making it much more secure.

This was originally decided at one point in 2.1.x releases but ended up being delayed up to 2.2.4 here.

* Messages from `welcomer`, `leave` and `leveling` are now fully consistent between test and normal ones
* `--buildinfo` for `version`: Make the displayed build branch hyperlinked


## Note
Due to internal changes within the code for Level up messages, it's settings such as the Level up channel has been reset so you have to re-set the channel and other data that has been reset too.
